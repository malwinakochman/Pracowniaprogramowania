Some people prefer to travel by ship when possible. 
There are large liners, holiday ships and river boats 
on board which you can visit different countries or 
parts of their country. Ships are not so fast as t
rains or planes, but a sea voyage or river trip is 
a very pleasant way of spending a holiday. Stewards 
and stewardesses keep the cabins clean and tidy. 
A cabin has beds, chairs, wardrobes, dressing tables,
etc. Large rooms in a ship are called saloons, so 
when you see Dining Saloon you know where to go to 
when it is time for lunch. The passengers do not pay 
for their meals on board a ship. The passengers have 
every opportunity to enjoy themselves. They play tennis 
or badminton on the deck. They sit on the deck, watching 
the sea or river and enjoying the sun. There are film shows 
and concerts pretty often, and dancing almost every 
evening. At every port of call they can go ashore 
and enjoy sightseeing excursions and bathing in the sea.
Modern life is impossible without travelling. Railways, 
ports and airports are full of people hurrying to catch 
a train, a ship or a plain. Man has always wanted to use 
the fastest way of travelling. It’s aviation. Passengers 
arrive at the airport in cars, taxes, trolley-buses and 
buses. Some people wait for their planes in comfortable 
chairs in the waiting-rooms. Some passengers prefer 
spending time in a cafe, where tea, coffee, soft drinks,
sandwiches and cakes are sold. Before they get aboard 
the plane they have their luggage registered. They 
don’t take their luggage with them, only a small bag.
The stewardess greets the passengers and shows them to their seats.
